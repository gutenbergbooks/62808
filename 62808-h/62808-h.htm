<p><span class="smcap">To</span> us Northerners few expressions convey such a
sense of peace and beauty as this of ‘in the gloaming.’
The twilight hour has had its singers and
idealisers ever since poetry found a voice and
made itself a power over men; and so long as
human nature is as it is now—impressionable,
yearning, influenced by the mystery of nature and
the sacredness of beauty—so long will the tenderness
of the gloaming find its answering echo in the
soul, and the sweet influences of the hour be
repeated in the depth of the emotions and the
purity of the thoughts.</p>

<p>Between the light and the dark—or as we have
it in our dear old local tongue, ‘’twixt the gloamin’
an’ the mirk’—what a world of precious memories
and holy suggestions lies enshrined! The French
<i>entre chien et loup</i> (between dog and wolf) is a
poor equivalent for our ‘gloaming;’ and going
farther south the thing is as absent as the
expression. To be sure the sweet Ave Maria
of the evening is to the pious Catholic all that
the twilight is to us; when the church bells ring
out the hour for prayer, and the sign that the
day’s work is done, and the hurrying crowd stands
for a moment hushed, with uplifted hands and
reverent faces raised to heaven, each man bareheaded
as he says his prayer, calling on Madonna
to help him and his. But in the fervid countries
which lie in the sunshine from winter to autumn
and from dawn to dark, there is no gloaming as
we have it. The sun goes down in a cloudless
glory of burnished gold or blazing red, of sullen
purple or of pearly opalescence; and then comes
darkness swift and sudden as the overflowing of
a tidal river; but of the soft gray luminous twilight—of
that lingering after-glow of sky and air
which we Northerners know and love—there is not
a trace. Just as with the people themselves it is
brilliant youth and glorious maturity, but for the
most part an old age without dignity or charm.
Nothing is so rare in southern climates as to see
an old woman with that noble yet tender majesty,
that gloaming of the mind and body, which makes
so many among us as beautiful in their own way
at seventy as they were at twenty. They fade
as suddenly as their twilight; and the splendour
of the day dies into the blackness of the night
with scarce a trace of that calm, soft, peaceful
period when it is still light enough for active life
and loving duties, after the fervour of the noon
has gone and before the dead dark has come.</p>

<p>The gloaming is the hour for some of the dearest
circumstances of life; when heart grows nearer to
heart, and there seems to be almost another sense
granted for the perception of spiritual things. It
is the hour when young lovers wander through
the green lanes between the hawthorn and the
clematis, while the nightingale sings in the high
elm-tree, and the white moths flit by like winged
ghosts or float like snow-flakes in the dusk. Or
if it is in the winter-time, they sit in the bay of
the window half hidden by the curtains, half revealed
by the dying light, as is their own love.
They have no need of speech. Nature and the
gloaming are the voices between them which
whisper in sigh and o’ercome all that the one
longs to tell and the other yearns to hear; and the
silence of their lips is the truest eloquence of their
hearts. In the full blaze of daylight that silence
would be oppressive or chilling. It would tell
either too much or not enough; but in the twilight,
when speech would be intrusive and commonplace,
the mute influences of the hour are the best
expressions of the soul. In meadow and wood
and garden the scents of flowers and sprouting
leaves, of moss and ferns and bark and bud, are
more fragrant now than in the freshness of even
the early dawn—that childhood of the day! They
too come like the voices of Nature, telling softly
secrets which the day cannot reveal. Everything
is dreamy, indeterminate, and full of possibilities
not yet realised. The moon is only a disc of
unsubstantial vapour hanging softly in the sky,
where the sunset tones still linger; the stars are
faint uncertain points scarcely visible through the
quivering chromatic haze; but gradually all this
mystery will sharpen into the confessed beauty
of the night, when the pale pure splendour of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>{146}</span>
moon, the glorious brightness of the stars, will
take the place of the gloaming. As yet it is
all softened colour and chastened tenderness; all
silence yet eloquence; and the young lovers wandering
by the scented hedgerows, or sitting in the
bay of the window—they in the soft glow of the
twilight, while the ruddy firelight floods the rest
of the room—are in that perfect harmony with
the circumstances round them of which the other
name is happiness. Yes, the gloaming is the hour
of love, as which of us does not know who has
ever loved at all! Look back over the lapse of
years, and see now what you saw then. You are
walking on that broad path up the lone fell-side.
The young bracken is sending out its rich scents,
mixed with the odour of thyme and the sweetness
of the golden gorse; the swallows are wheeling
for their last rapid flights; the homing rooks
are straggling wearily to the elms; the lark
is singing faintly in his descent; and the honey-laden
bees fly heavily to their hives. Do you not
remember the thoughts, the emotions which made
life for you at that moment a heavenly poem such
as an angel might have written? Do you not remember
the love which swelled your heart, and
lifted it up from earth to the very footstool of
God? Never can you forget the exquisite delight,
the unfathomable revelations of that hour! It
was in the gloaming when you told your love and
knew that you were beloved, when the rack and
the pain of doubt were finally set to rest, and the
joy of certainty was established! That hour shaped
your life for weal—alas! sometimes for woe to
follow after! But in all the woe of the loss, you
have the imperishable weal of the gain, and are
richer by the love that you gave as well as by that
which you received—by the memories that will
never die, and the emotions which you can never
forget!</p>

<p>The gloaming is the children’s hour, when
mamma sings sweet songs, or plays for them brisk
and lively music, to which they dance like shadowy
sprites in and out from the dusk to the light. Or
what is still dearer, she gathers them all close
about her, the elder ones touching her knees,
clinging to her shoulders, while the little one of
all is in her arms half asleep in a cloud of fairy
dreams of vague delight, as its curly head rests on
her bosom, and the sweet soft voice lulls its senses
into a state of enchantment, to which no opiate of
after-time gives aught that is like. Then she tells
them stirring tales of bold knights and lovely
ladies, and how faith and courage conquered all
the dangers that beset them, and brought them
to good issues through evil paths. Or in a lower
voice, she speaks to them of the great God in
heaven, who through all His supreme might and
majesty, can condescend even to the wants of
a little child; and she tells them of the sinless
angels; and of that dear Lord who came on the
earth to save weak men from the consequences of
their own wilful wickedness. She speaks to them
of His purity, His love, His tenderness, and of the
pattern left us in His life, by which we may all
walk if we will. And to the end of their lives
they remember those lessons of the quiet gloaming.
One may go out into wild lands and live there with
graceless men and Godless companions; but in the
midst of all the evil which surrounds him, the
mother’s words spoken when he was a little lad at
her knee, come back like cool rains in the parching
drought; and the crust of carelessness and something
worse breaks from his soul as memory leads
him back into what was the truest and holiest
Church of his youth. Or the girl—she who now
sits with her big blue eyes fixed on her mother,
shining with pitying tears for the sorrows of the
divine Son of Man, for the trials of suffering
saint and heroic martyr—when she is thrown
into the great world of fashion and dissipation to
become a ‘leader of society,’ surrounded by temptations
of all kinds—she too will remember this
hour, and all that she learned and felt at her
mother’s side. She will turn back to the holy
lessons of piety and humility, of modesty and
honour, taught her then by one who fulfilled those
lessons in her own life; and she will be strengthened
to meet her dangers from the memory of
those pure defences. The mother’s influence never
wholly dies; and never is that influence more
powerfully exerted, its traces more deeply engraved
than in the gloaming, when the sweet, sad
Bible stories are told in a low and loving voice,
till the whole heart is stirred, and the deepest
recesses of spiritual consciousness are reached.</p>

<p>The gloaming is the hour of the highest thoughts
of which we may be capable; the hour when the
poet sings his song in his own heart before he
has written down the words on paper; when the
painter sees his picture completed by the divine
artistry of the imagination before he has set his
palette or sketched in the outline; when the unformed
and chaotic thought long floating in the
brain, clears itself from the mists and takes definite
shape, soon to become embodied in creation. The
youth dreams of that splendid achievement which
is to win the great game of fortune; he sees himself
going up for his degree in advance of the rest,
cheered by his companions, congratulated by the
‘dons’ as he comes out Double-first, or the Senior
Wrangler of his year. Or he is pleading before
the judge at a very early stage in his legal career,
and winning the most important cause of the term—winning
it by sheer hard work and strength of
brain—with ‘silk’ and perhaps the woolsack to
follow. Or he is in the House arguing for
humanity against statecraft, for justice against
oppression, for truth against falsehood, and carrying
the majority with him—making men’s hearts
to burn within them by reason of his eloquence,
his daring, and the intrinsic justice of his cause,
for the first time indubitably proved by him.
Or he has written his book, and wakes to find
himself famous, the world lifting its cap to him
in recognition of his success, and the critics united
in praise, with not a surly note of blame in all
the pack. Or he has painted his heroic picture—his
art of the highest, his theme the most heroic—and
the Royal Academy opens its doors with a
clang to let him through. Or he has built his
cathedral, and is not ashamed to look up at the
lines of the old Abbey. Or he has invented his
new engine, discovered his new planet, demonstrated
the hidden law which so many suspect and
no one has proved. It is the hour for all these
grand dreams of ambition, all these fairy tales of
hope; and if impossible at times to realise, yet
they are good for the young mind to entertain;
as it is good for the young athlete to try his
strength against superior forces, and for the young
bowman to aim higher than he can strike.</p>

<p>It is the hour when greatness, yet inchoate and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>{147}</span>
undeveloped, grows within its husk—the seed-time
of future excellence through the fermentation
of thought. There must be intervals of preparation,
and this is one of them. The quiet spell of
the gloaming, when the fairest visions are seen,
the boldest wishes framed, the loftiest points
reached—how useful it is if taken as the spring-board
for the true leap—harmful enough if
accepted as sufficient in itself; as if the hope, the
wish, the incoherent intention were enough, and
realisation always put off till the morrow, did not
count. For there is ever the danger that day-dreaming
should become a habit, and that a man
should be contented with fashioning a thought in
his brain without caring to embody it in deed.
But there is always danger of misuse in all things;
and the fear of falling is no bad help towards
keeping one’s footing firm when the path is
slippery and the way-marks treacherous.</p>

<p>The gloaming is the hour for quiet retrospection
of the hours that are past, for fearless onlooking to
those which are to come, and for closer communing
with God and one’s own soul. The day is flowing
into the night through the golden gate of the twilight,
just as fervid youth and fragrant womanhood,
the strength of manhood and the leader’s power,
are passing through the calm rest of old age into
the stillness of death. In the gloaming, the soul
seems to see the right value and the true shapes
of things more clearly than it did when the sun
was high, and the eyes were dazzled with its shine
and the blood fevered with its heat. Then passion
was strong, and with passion, self-will, false aims,
false beliefs—and disappointment as the shadow
lying behind. If the power was there to create,
to resist, to combat, to subdue, so also was the
bitter smart and the cruel blow. And there was
the inevitable deception of the senses. Then the
sunlight fell on the stagnant waters of the deadly
swamp and turned them into lakes of purest gold,
which a wise man would spend his time well to
seek and his strength to possess. Now in the
twilight the false shine has faded from the low-lying
pools, and the dank and deadly mists creep
up to mark both their place and quality. If only
he had known the truth of things in time! If
only he had not believed that marsh-lands were
living lakes of golden waters, which a man would
do well to give his life to gain!</p>

<p>In the daytime, clouds obscured the sun, so that
the impatient and sore-hearted said in his bitterness
that the god had turned his face from the
earth and from him, and that to-morrow’s glory
would never rise. Now in the gloaming the hope
of that morrow has already lessened in anticipation
the evil done by the clouds of to-day, and trust
and hope come in the place of sorrow and despair.
The worst has been—make room now for the better.
No more false seeming and no more blinding by
the deceived and flattered senses; no more mis-diversion
of energy, and taking for pure and beautiful
waters of life deadly morass and stagnant
marsh. The gloaming of life sets a man straight
not only with himself but with things, and gives
him a truer knowledge than he ever had before.
He stands full face to the west and looks into
the light, which now he can bear, and which he no
longer finds bewildering or blinding. That time
of tumult and passion, of heat and strife, through
which he has passed, how glad he is to leave it all
behind him while waiting, watching for the quiet
peace of the night through the tender softness of
the gloaming! How near and yet how far off
seem to him the unfulfilled hopes of the morning,
the mistaken endeavour of the noon, the hard
labour and fierce struggle of the day! If he had
only known in time the things which were best for
him, how differently he would have acted—and
now: God’s will be done, and God pardon all his
sins! He must take things as they stand, trusting
in the unfailing mercy; for if repentance is good,
regret is vain, and the gloaming is for peace, not
strife.</p>

<p>Slowly the last rays of the sun fade out of the
sky, and the lingering light as slowly follows.
The world lies hushed as a tired sleeper, and the
moon and the stars come out as watchers—as signs
too of other worlds and other lives. But the old
man sitting pale and peaceful in the house-porch
knows now what he no longer sees; for the gloaming
of his life has passed into the deep stillness of
something beyond, as the day has flowed into the
night, and both lie in the hollow of God’s right hand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.—THE SHARING OF THE SPOIL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of Mr Enoch Wilkins, Solicitor in the
High Court of Chancery, and Attorney-at-law,
before, according to the polite legal fiction, the
Queen herself at Westminster, was deeply inscribed,
in fat black engraved characters, on a
gleaming brass plate which formed the chief adornment
of the dark-green door of his City office. If
this brass plate really did gleam, as it did, like a
piece of burnished gold, its refulgence was due to
unremitting exertions on the part of the office lad,
whose objurgations were frequent as at unholy
matutinal hours he plied the obdurate metal with
rotstone, oiled flannels, and chamois leather. For
the atmosphere of St Nicholas Poultney (so named
from the hideous effigy of a begrimed saint, mottled
by frost and blackened by soot, which yet
decorated the low-browed doorway of a damp little
church hard by) was not conducive to brilliancy,
whether of glass, brass, or paint, being heavily
charged, on the average of days, with tainted air,
foul moisture, and subdivided carbon, with rust,
dust, and mildew. Nevertheless Mr Wilkins, who
was a master to be obeyed, contrived that his plate-glass
windows should flash back whatever rays of
light the pitying sun might deign to direct on so
dismal a region, girt in and stifled by a wilderness
of courts, lanes, streets, and yards, and also that
door-handles and bell-pulls should be shining and
spotless as a sovereign new-minted, the door-step a
slab of unsullied stone, and passage, staircase, and
offices as trim and clean as the floors of some
lavender-scented farmhouse among the cabbage
roses of Cheshire. These praiseworthy results
were not attained without labour, sustained and
oft renewed, on the part of Mrs Flanagan, the so-called
laundress, whose washing was effected by
the vigorous application of scrubbing-brush and
Bath-brick; of a melancholy window-cleaner from
Eastcheap, whose bread was earned by perpetual
acrobatic feats on narrow sills and outside ledges;
and of the office lad already mentioned, whose
main duties, though he called himself a clerk, were
those of keeping the externals of his master’s place
of business at the utmost pitch of polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>{148}</span></p>

<p>In very truth, although there was a messenger,
fleet of foot and cunning in threading his way
through the labyrinthine intricacies of the City,
always perched on a leather-covered stool in the
antechamber, to supplement the services of the
office lad, Mr Wilkins had no clerk. A great deal
of his business was transacted by word of mouth;
he answered his own letters; and when much of
the scribe’s work became requisite, some civic law
stationer would send in one or two red-eyed men
in mouldy black, with finger-nails indelibly stained
by the ink that had become their owners’ element,
and a sufficient quantity of draught folio paper
would be covered with legal copperplate.</p>

<p>The outer office was neatness itself, from the
bright fire-irons in the fender to the maps on the
wall and the rulers and pewter inkstands on the
desks. And the inner room, where the lawyer
himself gave audience, was almost cheerful, with
its well-brushed Turkey carpet, sound furniture,
well-stored book-shelves, and general aspect of snug
comfort. There were those who wondered that Mr
Wilkins, whose reputation did not rank very high
in the learned confraternity to which he belonged,
should so pointedly have deviated from the tradition
which almost prescribes dirt and squalor and
darkness for the surroundings of those who live
by the law. There were, not very far off, most
respectable firms, the name of whose titled employers
was Legion, yet through whose cobwebbed
panes was filtered the feeble light by which their
bewildered clients stumbled among ragged carpets
and rickety furniture to reach the well-known beehive
chair. But Mr Wilkins was a man capable of
attending to his own interests, and probably he
had found out what best chimed with the prejudices
of those for whose custom he angled.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the room itself to shew
that it was a lawyer’s office. It might have been
that of a surveyor or a promoter of companies, for
there was nothing on the walls but a set of good
maps and four or five excellent engravings. Not
a deed-box, not a safe, was to be seen, and if there
were law-books on the shelves they held their place
unobtrusively amongst other well-bound volumes.
Mr Wilkins sitting in his usual place, with one
elbow resting on the table before him, seemed to
be indulging in a reverie of no distasteful character,
to judge by the smile that rested on his coarse
mouth as he softly tapped his front teeth with the
mother-of-pearl handle of a penknife, as though
beating time to his thoughts. At last, warned by
the striking of the office clock, the hour-hand of
which pointed to eleven, Mr Wilkins shook off his
preoccupation of mind, and rang the hand-bell at
his elbow.</p>

<p>The office lad, who called himself a clerk, was
prompt in answering the tinkling summons of his
employer.</p>

<p>‘Any one been here yet?’ demanded the lawyer.</p>

<p>‘Touchwood and Bowser’s articled clerk with
notice of new trial in case of Green (in holy
orders) <i>v.</i> Gripson—the bill-stealing case, you
know, sir, that the country parson chose to go to
a jury about.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes,’ rejoined Mr Wilkins, again tapping
his front teeth with the pearl-handled knife,
while a look of intense amusement overspread his
face. ‘Wants another shot at the enemy, does he,
the Rev. James Green! It was grand to see
him in the witness-box, indignantly insisting on
the fact that not one sixpence ever reached him in
return for his promissory-note despatched per
post, on the faith of Mr Gripson’s advertisement
and fair words. Then some Mr Jenks, a total
stranger, happens to give valuable consideration,
at third or fourth hand, for the stamped paper
with the clergyman’s signature, and, Rev. Green
objecting to cash up, gets a <i>fi. fa.</i>—a neat contraction
of <i>fieri facias</i>, which, as we lawyers know,
is a term which directs an execution to be levied
on the goods of a debtor, ha, ha!—has it backed in
Wiltshire, and sells up every bed and chest of
drawers in the vicarage. Mr Green brings an
action against Gripson, who is comfortably out of
the way, but retains me. We traverse everything,
demur to everything, put in counter pleas and
rebutters, change the venue, and play Old Gooseberry
with the too confiding Green, whose counsel
elects to be nonsuited. Now, like a Briton, he is
ready for us again.’</p>

<p>Mr Wilkins laughed, and the juvenile clerk
re-echoed the laugh. Sharp practice, such as that
so lovingly narrated by the attorney, apparently
for lack of a better audience, was congenial to the
mind of this keen-witted young acolyte of Themis,
with whom the proverbial distinction between
Law and Equity seemed to be very clearly defined.</p>

<p>‘Nobody else called?’ asked Mr Wilkins.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Stout sporting-looking gent, who said
he’d make shift, when I told him you had stepped
out to the Master’s chambers, to come again to-morrow.
Name of Prior,’ returned the youth.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Nat the bookmaker, wanting to know how
near the wind he may sail without getting into
the sweep-net of a criminal indictment,’ said the
lawyer placidly. ‘Nothing else, hey?’</p>

<p>‘Only Mr Isaacs of Bowline Court, Thames
Street, sent round to say he would look in
between eleven and twelve,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>‘I’ll see him and any gentleman he may bring
with him,’ rejoined Mr Wilkins, taking up the
newspaper, as the office lad retired; but in five
minutes returned, ushering in three gentlemen,
whose hooked noses, full red lips, jet-black hair,
and sloe-black eyes gave them a strong family
resemblance. They were old acquaintances doubtless,
for the greeting which they received from Mr
Wilkins was a familiar one.</p>

<p>‘How do, Moss? How goes it, Braham, my
buck? You’re all right, Isaacs, I can see for
myself.’</p>

<p>Nothing could well be more unlike what, during
the regency of the late King George IV., was
called a buck than was Mr Braham, who was
simply a corpulent Jew, ineffably greasy in appearance,
and who wore a faded olive-green greatcoat
that might have passed for a medieval gabardine,
and carried an empty blue bag over his left arm.
Mr Moss, his junior by some years, was better
dressed, but his raven locks fell upon a shirt collar
of dubious whiteness, and his dingy finger-nails
were in unpleasant contrast with the splendour
of the heavy rings he wore, and of the huge
emerald in his satin necktie. The youngest of
the three, Mr Isaacs, a hawk-eyed little man,
bejewelled and florid of attire, was by far in dress
and person the least unclean of the three.</p>

<p>There was a little conversation as to weather
and other general topics, and then Braham the
senior of the three Hebrews pulled out a watch
as round and almost as big as a golden turnip,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>{149}</span>
and compared it with the office clock. ‘Letsh get
along,’ he said genially: ‘bushinesh, bushinesh,
my dears, waitsh for no man.’</p>

<p>‘You’re right, Uncle Jacob,’ chimed in Mr
Moss, who could scarcely have been, otherwise
than figuratively and in oriental fashion, the
nephew of his stout kinsman, but who was
certainly a Jew of a much more modern pattern.
He, at anyrate, coquetted with soap and water,
and had discarded the shibboleth in his speech;
but it might be doubted whether the elder Israelite,
for all his repellent exterior, was not the better
fellow of the two.</p>

<p>‘Business by all means,’ cheerily responded Mr
Wilkins. ‘We’ve done it together before to-day,
and we’ll do it again, I hope, gentlemen, for many
a day yet to come. It is a very pleasant occasion
on which we now assemble—nothing less, if I may
say so, than the dividing of the profits, the sharing
of the spoil.’</p>

<p>There was a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>‘Sharing of the shpoil!’ chuckled elderly but
still vigorous Mr Braham. ‘What a boy he ish,
thish Wilkinsh, what a boy he ish!’</p>

<p>‘And now for it,’ said Mr Wilkins, rustling over
a bundle of papers that lay before him. ‘Here
we have it in black and white, worth all the
patter and palaver in the world. These are the
baronet’s first and second letters, the second inclosing
an uncommonly stiff cheque. Here are
Captain Denzil’s bills—pretty bits of kites they
are, renewed here and renewed there—and here
are our old agreements, notes, and memoranda,
duplicates of which I’ve no doubt are in all your
pockets. Pass them round, Isaacs, and take a
good look at them first. You’re an attorney, you
know, and that’s why you’re here, though I don’t
believe, my friend, that you “pull off” a clear five
hundred out of the haul.’</p>

<p>‘Yesh, yesh, he’sh an attorney, ash Wilkinsh
saysh,’ said Mr Braham, whose laughter was very
ready, as that of fat people often is; ‘and sho
we have him here. Shet a thief to catch a’——</p>

<p>Here a warning kick or other practical exhortation
to caution on the part of his kinsman appeared
to cut short the over-fluency of the bulky Hebrew,
and he became as mute as a mouse, while Mr
Isaacs read aloud in a high shrill voice the contents
of Sir Sykes Denzil’s letters and also a brief
summary which Mr Wilkins had prepared.</p>

<p>There was some discussion, but there really was
not room for much. Here was no compromise, no
handing over of so many shillings in the pound.
Sir Sykes Denzil had paid his son’s liabilities
without the abatement of a guinea. Mr Braham
was to receive what he called ‘shix thoushand
odd;’ Mr Moss, two thousand eight hundred and
seventy-two; four hundred and thirty were for
Mr Isaacs; and the residue was for Enoch Wilkins,
Esquire, gentleman.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight when the rolls of bank-notes
were produced, to see the actual partition
of the Bank of England’s promises to pay, the
vulture beaks bending over the crisp paper, the
wary inspection of water-mark and number and
signature, and the stuffing of pocket-books and
cramming of purses and stowing away of what
seemed to be regarded rather as plunder than
as lawful gains. Two odd things during this
transaction were to be noticed—first, that Mr
Braham, who was incomparably the shabbiest Jew
present, met with deference on every hand save
from irreverent Wilkins; and secondly, that all
the Jews seemed to take up their money grudgingly,
like hounds that have chopped their fox in
covert.</p>

<p>‘Well done, Shir Shykesh!’ exclaimed the heavy
Hebrew with the green gabardine and the blue
bag. ‘If they wash all of hish short, there might
be the moneysh, but there wouldn’t be the fun!’</p>

<p>‘We’ll drink Sir Sykes’ health, at anyrate,’
briskly put in Mr Wilkins.—‘Sims!’ and he
tinkled the office hand-bell as he spoke, ‘glasses
and cork-screw.’</p>

<p>It was good amber-hued sherry, none of your
modern abominations, but a real Spanish vintage,
long mellowed in its dusty bin, that gurgled into
the glasses under the careful handling of Mr
Wilkins. The Hebrews sipped, appraised—where
could be found judges so critical!—and drank.</p>

<p>‘I’m shorry for the poor young man,’ said Mr
Braham, in a sort of outburst of sentiment, at
mention of Captain Denzil’s name.</p>

<p>‘So that he gets his victuals,’ remarked the Jew
attorney curtly, ‘I don’t see why he’s to be pitied.’</p>

<p>‘It <i>ish</i> a shelling out!’ was the mild rejoinder
of the stout Israelite with the blue bag, who
seemed to be by far the softest-hearted of the
company. ‘Of courshe, when I thought he would
do me, I didn’t care; but now I remember he
didn’t get much, not above sheven-fifty cash. All
the resht wash pictures, wine—not like yoursh,
Wilkinsh—cigars, and opera-tickets.’</p>

<p>‘He went through the mill, I suppose,’ said Mr
Moss, ‘as others have done before him, and others
will do after him; eh, Uncle Jacob?’</p>

<p>‘Eh, eh, grisht to the mill!’ chuckled the stout
proprietor of the empty blue bag; and the quartette
of confederates soon separated.</p>

<p>Mr Wilkins, left alone, purred contentedly as he
poured out and tossed off another glass of the
sherry so deservedly lauded, and then, rising from
his chair, took down a Baronetage, bound in pink
and gold, and fluttered over the leaves until his
finger rested on the words: ‘Denzil, Sir Sykes; of
Carbery Chase, county Devon; of Threepham
Lodge, Yorkshire; Ermine Moat, Durham; and
Malpas Wold, Cheshire, succeeded <i>his</i> father, Sir
Harbottle Denzil, August 18—; married, May
18—; formerly in the army, and attained the rank
of Major. Is a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant
for Devonshire. Unsuccessfully contested the
county at the election of 18—.’</p>

<p>‘To think,’ said the attorney, stroking the book
with his fleshy hand, ‘how much one can read
between the lines of these plausible announcements,
almost as blandly eulogistic as the inscriptions
which chronicle on their tombstones fond
wives, faultless husbands, and parents worthy to
be immortalised by Plutarch! How trippingly the
name of that needy old reprobate Sir Harbottle
rolls off the tongue. He to be described as of
Threepham and Malpas! Say, rather, of any
foreign lodging or foreign jail, of the Isle of Man
while it was yet a sanctuary for the debtor, of the
Rules of the King’s Bench. But Carbery is very
genuine anyhow.’</p>

<p>Mr Wilkins paused for a moment, and then
mused: ‘I could spoil your little game, Sir Sykes—spoil
it in a moment, and compel you to exchange
your D. L.’s uniform of scarlet and gold for—never
mind what! So long as the goose lays the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>{150}</span>
golden eggs, it would not be the part of a wise
man to twist her neck.’ Having said which, Mr
Wilkins brushed his coat, drew on his gloves,
and taking up his hat, sallied out. ‘Taxing
office; back in an hour,’ he said to the office lad
as he went out. ‘If I am detained, you need not
wait for me after two o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘Ten to four, he don’t shew up,’ said the youth,
who was accustomed to the professional figments
which served to beguile credulous clients, but who
congratulated himself at the prospect of a speedy
release from duty. ‘If the governor doesn’t put
in an appearance by 1.30, I’ll make myself scarce,
or my name is not Sims!’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Wilkins made his way through
the jostling crowd that roared and seethed among
the busy streets of the City, until he reached an
office, resplendent with plate-glass and French-polished
mahogany, in Cornhill, on the door of
which was inscribed, ‘Bales and Beales, Stock and
Share Brokers.’</p>

<p>There were a good many customers in the outer
office, a few of whom were quiet men of business,
while the others, nearly half of whom were
anxious-eyed ladies who had reached middle life,
seemed flushed and ill at ease as they perused and
reperused the written and printed memoranda
with which they all seemed to be provided, and
glanced impatiently at the ornamental clock on
its gilded bracket. The lawyer, as an <i>habitué</i> of
the place, sent in his name, and gained speedy
admittance to the inner den, where Mr Bales
himself, tall, thin, and with a thatch of bushy
eyebrows projecting in pent-house fashion over his
steady blue eyes, held out a cool white hand to be
grasped by the hot red hand of Mr Wilkins.</p>

<p>The head of the firm of Bales and Beales was
pre-eminently a cool man, and nothing could be
in stronger contrast than was his unimpassioned
bearing and the flutter and flurry of his customers.</p>

<p>‘How about my Turks?’ unceremoniously demanded
Mr Wilkins. ‘Of course I know they’re
down again—confound them!’</p>

<p>‘The fall continues. They have receded, let
me see, two and seven-eighths since this morning,’
returned the broker, pointing to the official
bulletin in its frame on the wall beside him.
‘Probably they are falling as we speak, for the
Bourses of Paris, Amsterdam, and Vienna opened
heavily.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you <i>are</i> a Job’s comforter, Bales,’ said
the lawyer, wiping his heated brow. ‘Will this
sort of thing go on, hey? Shall I sell, or stick
to my colours like a Briton? Can’t you give a
fellow your advice?’</p>

<p>‘I never advise,’ answered Mr Bales, with his
cold smile. ‘Life would be a burden to me if I
did. I prefer to lay the facts before those who do
me the favour to come to me, leaving to their
unbiassed judgment the course to pursue. Here
are some Stock Exchange telegrams, part of which
you will see presently, no doubt, in the evening
papers. They help to explain the rush on the
part of the public to sell out.’</p>

<p>The attorney took the half-dozen square pieces
of hastily printed paper, yet damp from the
press, some of them, which Mr Bales courteously
proffered him, and at a glance mastered their
contents.</p>

<p>‘Can rascally fabrications like this,’ asked the
attorney, in a glow of something like honest
indignation, ‘impose upon the veriest gull in
Christendom?’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ answered the unmoved Mr Bales, scrutinising
the despatch which his irate client held
between his finger and thumb, ‘you mean the
rumour about the sale of the six Turkish ironclads
to the Russian government? Popular credulity,
my dear sir, would swallow more than that. You
have overlooked the other telegram, which mentions
that Adamapoulos and Nikopolos, the Greek
bankers of Galata, have declined to advance to
the Porte at twenty per cent. the wherewithal to
meet the next coupon of the Debt. That report
has more weight with business-men than the
nautical one. Will you give me instructions to
sell?’</p>

<p>‘No; but to buy!’ rapped out Mr Wilkins, with
suddenness. ‘There must come a reaction soon.
I’ll take another ten thousand of the Imperial
Ottomans. I know what you would say, Bales,’
he added irritably: ‘the cash I left on deposit
won’t cover the margin. Here’—and he produced
the bank-notes that had fallen to his share in the
division of that day—‘are funds, and to spare.’</p>

<p>As the lawyer quitted the stock-broker’s office
he muttered between his set teeth: ‘I stand to
win; but at anyrate I know of back-play of a safer
sort. Sir Sykes Denzil of Carbery, you are a
sponge well worth the squeezing!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SENSATIONAL_REPORTING">SENSATIONAL REPORTING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> a week passes in which the newspaper
press is not the medium of attracting the attention
of the public to a <i>cause célèbre</i> of one kind or
another. Crimes of brutal violence, of gross immorality,
of wholesale fraud, have been so terribly
prevalent of late, that we might almost believe
that civilisation and crime are going hand in hand;
certainly the horrors of the latter go a considerable
way towards neutralising the blessings of the
former, and cause us to pause in our self-congratulation
upon the progress and enlightenment of the
age in which we live. At but too frequent intervals
some villain is held up before the public, and
becomes, so to speak, fashionable for the period
over which his trial extends.</p>

<p>Every class of society provides its recruits now
and again for the ranks of the infamous, and no
matter to which stratum the criminal belongs,
one newspaper or another is sure to be ready to
report—with a minuteness which could not be
more detailed if it were inspired by personal
animosity—every stage and incident of his crime,
and if procurable and sufficiently sensational, to
supply an epitome of his antecedent career.</p>

<p>When the influence of the press is properly taken
into consideration, the responsibility of writing
for it is a very serious one. To many thousands
even in great centres of human life like London,
Liverpool, Glasgow, or Edinburgh, the daily paper
is almost the sole intellectual food sought for
and within reach; and when we further consider
the immense circulation of some of our newspapers,
nearly approaching a quarter of a million
a day, and when we think that each copy becomes
the centre of an ever-increasing circle of information,
we may reasonably assert that the penny
paper, once held in contempt, is one of the most
potent agents for good or evil which our generation
possesses; and in proportion to the influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>{151}</span>
which it exerts, is the necessity of that
influence being exerted in a right direction. So
far as regards politics, theology, and social problems,
each paper may legitimately represent a
particular party or sect, and inculcate its particular
views; but upon certain broad principles
of morality, and as far as regards general rules for
the inculcation and protection of public morals,
there ought to be no difference of opinion at all.</p>

<p>Without question, the newspapers of our day are
animated by a laudable desire to act for the moral
as well as material welfare of the people, and we
could not accuse any one of them of voluntarily
inserting matter having a tendency subversive to
morality; but as to what is and what is not calculated
to taint the public mind, the opinion of the
press seems to be very undecided. Particularly
is this the case with regard to the record of
crime, which it is part of their duty to publish.
It is unquestionably advisable that the public
should be informed of every crime that is discovered;
but the scope of the information to be
given becomes a matter for careful consideration,
and upon which some difference of opinion may
reasonably be expected to exist.</p>

<p>What, it may be asked, is the object of a
public report of the trial of a criminal? Presumably
that by the knowledge of what has
occurred the public may be on their guard
against similar crimes, and that the story of
detection and punishment may act as a deterrent;
the first of these objects applying more
particularly to what we may call the respectable
classes, and the latter to the criminal, vicious, or
viciously disposed. The story of crime should
legitimately produce in the public mind a sense of
indignation against the criminal, of pity for the
victim, of personal caution; the criminal should
not be considered a sort of social scapegoat, and
the indignation should not be Pharisaical, but
should have its origin in an abhorrence of the
crime rather than of the criminal. To the
viciously inclined the story of detected crime
should be a warning and a deterrent, both on the
score of fear of detection as also upon higher moral
considerations. The history of crime or of a
criminal career is invariably pitiable enough; but
it is possible in some instances to invest it with a
spurious interest, and even a sort of meretricious
brilliance which is calculated to work an immense
amount of harm among a certain class of people.</p>

<p>The principal object of a newspaper report
nowadays would seem to be to present the public
with an exciting and dramatic narrative, rather
than a calm, unimpassioned statement of facts; to
write, in short, rather for their amusement than
information. Undoubtedly few things increase the
sale of a newspaper more than a graphic account of
heart-rending ‘Scenes in Court,’ and the demeanour,
for instance, of ladies who have been accommodated
with seats on the bench! a style of reporting
which seems to us to be little short of a breach
of trust, inasmuch as it is pandering to that which
it ought to suppress.</p>

<p>It may be said that in criminal cases it is
well that the public should have the fullest possible
details of the proceedings, so that they
may follow them closely, and perhaps aid in the
administration of justice; but as public comment
upon cases <i>still under trial</i> is not recognised, the
value of full reports is nullified so far as this consideration
is concerned. But if a judge, a man
of eminent experience in human nature, learned
in the law, and accustomed to the consideration
of every variety of evidence; and twelve jurymen,
well meaning, unprejudiced, of business habits
and unimpassioned judgment, cannot be trusted
to decide a case upon its merits, surely it would
be unreasonable to suppose that the outside public
could do better, reading as they do simply
in print the words which may have had their
significance increased immeasurably in either
direction by the tone in which they were uttered,
by the bearing of the speaker, and the voluntary or
involuntary gestures which may have accompanied
them.</p>

<p>When we read detailed accounts of the appearance
of prisoners, verbatim reports of their most
insignificant utterances; when we are given details
of their meals; when we are told that one prisoner
is dressed with scrupulous care, and that the
affection existing between two other prisoners was
very apparent to those in court; when we have a
picture of the judge passing sentence amidst
sobbing women; when piquant details of past
careers are dragged to light, and the various amiable
or vicious points commented upon, although
having absolutely no bearing whatever upon the
case under consideration—then we cannot avoid
the conclusion that the main object of all the report
is to sell the paper. It would be impossible to
give the public such information regarding the
demeanour and tone of witnesses or prisoners
as to enable them to form a really just and
reliable idea; while it is quite possible and a very
frequent practice to be just graphic enough to
make the public fancy that they are in a position
not only to criticise and speculate, but to dogmatise,
and even to protest vehemently against the
verdict of a jury and the sentence of a judge,
deliberately given after a long and careful inquiry,
in which the prisoner had the benefit of counsel
learned in every intricacy and subtlety of the law.
The practice of giving detailed descriptions of the
personal appearance and social habits of criminals,
which are now acknowledged features of newspaper
reporting, has a tendency to invest the
prisoners with something of a meretricious glory,
which ought to be condemned by all properly
minded people.</p>

<p>If crime has been committed, it is surely injurious
to the public morals to write or publish anything
calculated to elicit misplaced sympathy, and
it is a poor trade to pander to morbid curiosity.
If people fairly appreciated not only the wickedness
and horror of crime, but its almost invariable
meanness, pettiness, and misery, its feverish restlessness,
its ever-haunting dread of detection—crime
would be robbed of much of its semi-heroic
character, and would cease to prove so attractive
a bait to those who gloat over its every detail.
It is common to speak of ‘great’ criminals as
distinguished from the vulgar herd; but there is
never anything great in crime. Graphic pens
pandering to vulgar curiosity may produce a
passing interest of even absorbing intensity; the
crime and the criminal may form a nine days’
wonder; but the end comes; and as soon as the
convict dress is donned, the erstwhile man is
degraded into a mere automaton, a mere numeral,
and is utterly dead to the outside world; while if
the scaffold should be his destined finale, the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>{152}</span>
thing which survives the wretched criminal is his
infamy.</p>

<p>Sensational reporting pays, for papers with a
reputation for ‘Special’ descriptions are at a premium
whenever there is a <i>cause célèbre</i> before the
public; but it is eminently prejudicial to public
morality. The remedy rests solely with the proprietors,
on whom lies also the responsibility of
purveying garbage to an unhappily large section
of readers; but until public opinion forces upon
them the fact that they are deliberately lowering
themselves to the level of the vendors of ‘Penny
Dreadful’ literature, sensational reporting of criminal
trials is likely to flourish, inoculating the
public mind with an unwholesome craving for
details which should be banished from the pale of
discussion among people with any pretensions to
refinement, good taste, or common decency.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BONE-CAVE_INSCRIPTION">THE BONE-CAVE INSCRIPTION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasant town of Q——, among its other
attractions, possesses a bone-cave. The cave,
situated in a little valley close by the sea, had not
long been discovered to contain bones before it
was invaded by an army of geologists, who dug
deep holes in the floor, and unearthed the remains
of prehistoric fires, of ancient knives and needles,
and of even a man’s jaw buried in stalagmite. And
every year the fashionable people of Q—— made
an excursion into the windings of the cavern, under
the guidance of gnome-like guides with torches.</p>

<p>Within a certain period of its modern history,
the Q—— bone-cave, like the sacred caves of
India, had a high-priest, an exponent of its
mysteries. He did not, however, dwell in its
recesses, but in a smart villa overlooking Q——
Bay. He was a local celebrity, and the most
active member of a committee appointed to examine
the cavern. The cavern was his hobby,
and as it was of tolerably uniform temperature,
there was no time of year when he did not take
delight in exploring its mysteries. Every fresh
discovery was a joy to Mr Grope; and though a
sceptical few laughed at him, and even called some
of his flint knives in question, his researches had
thrown much light on geology and archæology.
One thing alone was wanting—he had found no
dates in the cave. There were dates and inscriptions
in caves belonging to other places, and he did
not like Q—— to be behind them.</p>

<p>Prefacing, for the benefit of the reader, that
stalac<i>tite</i> is the substance that hangs to the roof of
caverns, like icicles, and stalag<i>mite</i> the substance
that has fallen to the floor, a concretion of carbonate
of lime—we proceed with the story. One
day, as Mr Grope was examining a wall in one of
the passages, he thought he detected a weakness in
the rock, and working at it with his great hammer
he found that it speedily crumbled away. Soon
he had made a hole through which he was able to
pass, and presently he stood in a small apartment
full of large stalagmitic blocks, and with a very
moderate amount of water dripping from the roof.
As he flashed his lantern about, his keen eye
caught sight of artificial markings on the smooth
surface of one of the blocks. His heart leaped
within him. Here of a certainty was at last an
inscription which, composed of several well-formed
letters carved on the block but interrupted
by breaks, ran as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
F . . ll . . . to . . . Nor.<br />
      Capt T . . ck<br />
     r . . m  20&nbsp;&nbsp;Br<br />
  15 . . 71&nbsp;&nbsp;k . . to ret
</p>

<p>Mr Grope carefully copied the interesting record
into his note-book. He looked about for more
inscriptions, but this was apparently the only
one; however, there might be other unexplored
caverns beyond. At present he must devote
himself to deciphering these letters. He had
a clue in the date 1571, for though there was a
break between the ‘15’ and the ‘71,’ it was only
caused by a slight inequality in the block.</p>

<p>That evening, in the seclusion of his study, he
devoted himself with ardour to the inscription.
He did not doubt that it was intended for abbreviated
Latin. In the sixteenth century every one
who could write knew Latin, and wrote Latin too
when he or she wished to be succinct. There were,
it is true, only scraps of words on which to proceed,
but this circumstance did but occasion a
pleasing exercise of Mr Grope’s ingenuity. The
conquest would have been too easy had the words
been given at length. The very uncertainty had
in it that excitement which is dear to the hearts of
all true antiquaries.</p>

<p>Before he thoroughly set to his task, Mr Grope
balanced in his mind whether he should treat the
inscription as private or political. He inclined to
the political aspect. If it were private, nothing
could be made of it, and it was unlikely that a
gentleman should carve his personal remarks in
the depths of a subterranean cave. No doubt the
letters referred to public matters. For a moment
Mr Grope could not recollect who reigned in
England in 1571; for though he took a great
interest in history, he was somewhat oblivious
about dates. Soon, however, a vision of Queen
Elizabeth in ruff and farthingale rose before him,
and then he attacked the first line in good earnest.</p>

<p class="center">
F . . ll . . . to . . . Nor.<br />
</p>

<p>Now it seemed clear as noonday that Nor was
the first syllable of a proper name, or at least
the name of a place; for Mr Grope remembered
that in the sixteenth century it was
not the custom to begin every noun with a
capital letter, as it was in the eighteenth.
Could it refer to Norwich? Norwich was a long
way from Q——; but the gentleman in the cave
might have been mixed up in a conspiracy which
embraced the capture of several towns. Mr
Grope took down Mr Froude’s <i>History of England</i>,
and turned over the pages referring to Elizabeth’s
reign in search of names beginning with Nor.
Then a great light broke upon him, and he wondered
that he had not remembered his history
better. The name of Norfolk occurred several
times in connection with what Mr Froude calls the
‘Ridolfi Plot,’ and the ‘Ridolfi Plot’ was going on
in 1571. The course of his investigation seemed
to flow almost too smoothly now. He soon found
that the first line ran: ‘Fallete tollite Norfolk’
(Betray and take Norfolk); whence it was evident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>{153}</span>
that the man in the cave had played false to
all parties, and after engaging in the conspiracy,
had leagued with some fellow-conspirators to betray
their chief, the unhappy Duke who preceded Mary
of Scotland to the scaffold instead of sharing her
throne. ‘Betray and take Norfolk!’ It was not
good Latin certainly, but good enough for an
inscription where there were so many breaks,
which imagination could fill up with the elegances
of language; and the morality was characteristic of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The second line of the inscription puzzled Mr
Grope more.</p>

<p class="center">
Capt T . . ck
</p>

<p>The two words composing it were carved in
larger letters, and stood by themselves, as if
specially important. ‘Capt’ of course meant
<i>caput</i>, a head, and might hint at the approaching
loss of Norfolk’s own; but the ‘T . . ck’ puzzled
Mr Grope sorely, and was evidently another
cognomen. It puzzled him so much that he
resolved to finish the remainder of the inscription</p>

<p class="center">
r . . m&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;Br
</p>

<p>first, and see if <i>it</i> threw any light on the subject.</p>

<p>The ‘20’ evidently indicated the day of the
month; but to what month could ‘r . . m’ refer?
Could it mean <i>rosarum mensis</i>—the month of
roses? Might not a poetical conspirator thus
paraphrase the month of June? Norfolk certainly
was not beheaded till June 1572; but it was possible
that a fellow-plotter might have decided on
betraying him a full year before that date. ‘Br’
perhaps stood for <i>brevi</i>, by way of urging that the
deed should be accomplished summarily; and
1571 spoke for itself. The ‘k’ which followed
might be either a small or a capital ‘k,’ but Mr
Grope concluded that it was the initial of another
proper name; and he had soon persuaded himself
that the sentence ‘K .. to ret’ ran: ‘K—— tollite
retinete,’ and was intended as an injunction to
take and retain K——. Who or what K—— was
did not much signify, since there was no doubt
about Norfolk.</p>

<p>It was the second line which continued to puzzle
Mr Grope. He brooded over it when he went to
bed, and could not sleep because of it; but in the
small-hours of the morning, that season of daring
inspirations, it flashed across him that ‘Capt
T..ck’ meant neither more nor less than ‘Caput
Turci,’ a Turk’s head. ‘The man may have
written <i>k</i> for <i>i</i> by inadvertence. But why
should a Turk’s head be written about in the
cave near Q——?’ It struck Mr Grope that
the battle of Lepanto had been fought in 1571,
and that the conspirator might be alluding to
an invasion of England which was to take
place, when the Turk’s head should be figuratively
cut off. On the following morning, a Dictionary
of Dates accompanied the ham and toast
on Mr Grope’s breakfast-table; and he ascertained
that the battle of Lepanto had been fought in
October, whereas he had decided that the inscription
was written in June, and that it had something
to do with English refugees and the Turkish
fleet. This interpretation certainly gave a wider
and more European interest to the writing in the
Q—— bone-cave. But on further consideration, it
seemed to Mr Grope that he would hardly be able
to maintain it in printed controversy with the
learned. The Turk’s head was pitchforked with so
much abruptness among the directions to secure
Norfolk and K——, that unless it were supposed
to be a watchword among the conspirators, it
seemed impossible to dovetail it in.</p>

<p>The antiquary did not go out that morning; he
retired to his study and reflected on the difficulties
of the Turk’s head. At last another light came
in upon him, reminding him that there were
many inns in the country with the sign of the
Saracen’s Head, relics of the medieval time when
the Saracens were the bugbears of Europe. Very
likely there had been inns called the Turk’s Head
in the sixteenth century, when Europe was always
in terror of the Turks, and Mr Grope even fancied
that he remembered seeing one with that sign
in a village in the east of England. Looked at in
this new light, the meaning of the inscription
appeared to be: ‘Betray and take Norfolk at the
“Turk’s Head” inn, on the 20th of June 1571,
with all possible haste. Take and retain K——.’</p>

<p>Writing this out at full length, Mr Grope read
it over with fond pride. He had thoughts of
sending a letter on the subject to that scientific
paper the <i>Minerva</i> at once, but prudence intervened,
and he determined that he would first
consult Sir H—— T——, the great archæologist,
whom he had helped to lionise at Q——.
It would be as well to say, when he wrote to
the <i>Minerva</i>, that his friend Sir H—— T——
agreed with him as to the solution of the mystery;
and he accordingly despatched a full account
of the matter to the great man. That evening
Mr Grope dined out, and could not refrain
from imparting his triumph to a select circle of
his acquaintances. Mr Grope was generally
admitted to be the most intellectual resident at
Q——. If a strange fish was caught in the bay, a
strange fossil found in a quarry, or a coin dug up
in a field, it was always referred to Mr Grope;
and there were only one or two people who ever
presumed to smile at his conclusions. And now
when Mr Grope dilated on the conspirator and the
inscription in the newly-found cavern, addressing
in his drawling tones the small audience in the
drawing-room after dinner—for he had kept the
sensation for the benefit of the ladies—no one
arose to dispute his explanation. The conspirator’s
mention of the month of roses was especially
attractive and convincing.</p>

<p>But it came to pass that Sir H—— T—— was
not quite convinced. That savant thought it not
impossible that the inscription might have something
to do with the Ridolfi Plot, as the date was
1571; but as to the rest he differed from Mr
Grope, courteously but decidedly. He did not
believe in the Latin, and especially in Mr Grope’s
Latin. He did not believe in the poetic paraphrase
of June. He had read a good deal of
sixteenth-century correspondence, and had never
found a conspirator or any one else who spoke of
June as the month of roses. ‘Nor’ might stand
for Norfolk, though such was not Sir H——
T——’s opinion. Did Mr Grope think that the
inscription was either partly or wholly written in
cipher?</p>

<p>To say that Mr Grope was not disappointed,
would not be adhering to the truth. He had
arranged the matter in his mind, and had foreseen
a triumphant career for his inscription among the
archæologists and historians. It seemed impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>{154}</span>
that Sir H—— could doubt such inevitable
conclusions. The whole thing, as Mr Grope
made it out, had fitted together like a Chinese
puzzle. Yes, he almost resolved to persevere in his
own view. To hold a controversy with Sir H——
T—— might make him nearly as great a man as
Sir H—— himself. But he felt in his heart that
no one would side with the Turk’s Head and the
month of roses when Sir H—— was against them.
Mr Grope was convinced of the truth of his own
interpretation; but he would collect another possible
meaning or two, and while pronouncing in
favour of the first, submit the others to the learned
public. After all, the idea of a cipher opened out
a pleasing vista of conjecture. Much conjecture
there must of course be, when conspirators would
write in disjointed fragments. In the Ridolfi Plot
he possessed at least a basis of operations.</p>

<p>It so happened that our antiquarian friend had
some acquaintance with a gentleman who was now
searching the archives at Simancas for facts to
confirm a favourite theory, and who had on one
occasion dined with him at Q——; and to him
Mr Grope now conceived the happy thought of
writing, with a request that he would send him
a few of the ciphers used by Philip II. and his
correspondents. In due time he received the keys
of five or six ciphers, inclosed in a courteous note.
The historian himself had sympathy with Mr
Grope’s efforts in the cause of archæological
science, and had besides, a lively recollection of
Mr Grope’s ’47 port.</p>

<p>And now Mr Grope spent a long morning in
his study with the ciphers before him, labouring
to make them fit in with the inscription.
If cipher really had been used, it seemed probable
that English would have been used also.
On this assumption, therefore, he proceeded;
but the first few keys which he applied unlocked
nothing but sheer nonsense. The next
especially attracted Mr Grope, inasmuch as the
historian told him that it had been used by Mary
Queen of Scots. He had reserved it as his last
hope; and on further investigation he found that
in this cipher, London was termed Norway, and
thus written plainly without further disguise.
With regard to words which were not proper
names, the fifth and sixth letters from the one
intended <i>were used alternately</i>. When Mr Grope
applied this key to the inscription, he came to the
conclusion that it suited it admirably, with the
exception of that unfortunate second line, which
had puzzled him so much before. He really
thought, that as those two words ‘Capt T..ck,’
were written in larger letters than the others,
and conspicuously placed by themselves, they
might be actually put down as a watchword;
Why not, after all, ‘Caput Turci?’ The rest of
the inscription he transposed as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
h..rr yu Lon<br />
w . . . s 20 g w<br />
1571  p yu wky.<br />
</p>

<p>The sequence of letters was not kept up in the
second ‘yu,’ the fifth being used where the sixth
ought to be; but as the word was apparently the
second person plural, Mr Grope thought it probable
that the conspirator would not be particular in his
counting where so small a word was concerned.
It is convenient in such matters to allow for a
little negligence. In its new aspect Mr Grope
saw the inscription thus:</p>

<p class="center">
hurry you Londonwards<br />
with speed twenty great wagons<br />
1571.&nbsp;&nbsp;pay you weekly.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr Grope’s head now absolutely ached with
his efforts, and he drew his hand down his long
gray beard with a feeling of relief as he leaned
back in his chair. He nevertheless believed that
this last labour was in a measure thrown away,
and that the first solution was the right one.
Still there was an air of probability about that
‘pay you weekly,’ a matter-of-fact air such as he
remembered to have observed when reading a
printed volume of <i>Domestic State Papers</i>; and it
would sound well to have tried five ciphers on
the inscription and found a possible solution at
last. That same day Mr Grope wrote at length
to the <i>Minerva</i>, describing his discovery of the
new cavern and the inscription, and giving his
two explanations. For himself, he said, he believed
in the Latin version, though he was aware that
he had the disadvantage of differing from his
learned friend Sir H—— T——. In deference
to that gentleman’s opinion, he had compared the
writing with many ciphers in use in the sixteenth
century, and now submitted the result to the
attention of the scientific world.</p>

<p>The learned were only too willing to discuss it,
and several letters on the subject appeared in the
next number of the <i>Minerva</i>. One gentleman
approved the deciphered version; others proposed
solutions of their own, much more absurd than
any which Mr Grope had thought of. Next
week a letter from Sir H—— T—— himself was
printed, in which he expressed his opinion in
favour of Mr Grope’s second explanation. Mr
Grope and his new cavern had become famous.
The intellectual world at Q—— itself was greatly
impressed with the erudition of his researches.
Fashion and science ran into each other a good
deal at Q——; and there were some needlessly
pretty toilets among the party of friends whom
Mr Grope conducted to visit the muddy recesses
of his new cavern. There was also a geologist,
but he rather despised the inscription as being
too recent, and talked chiefly about eyeless fish.
The young ladies, knowing little of either the
Duke of Norfolk or the eyeless fish, explored
the gloomy recesses, and filled them with the
sounds of laughter and fun. Only one young lady
observed to her companions: ‘I shouldn’t wonder
if Mr Grope is wrong after all.’</p>

<p>A few days later the antiquary met at an evening
party, the son of an old inhabitant of Q——,
who had been dead for some years, but whom Mr
Grope had formerly known. He had known the
son too, who was now a Fellow of his college.
He was a little blunt, bullet-headed man, and
when presently the subject of the Q—— bone-cave
came up, he said what he thought without
any preface.</p>

<p>‘I fancy, Mr Grope, you’re wrong about that
inscription after all. I suppose you never heard
my father speak of old Truck the smuggler?’</p>

<p>‘No; I did not,’ said Mr Grope, concealing his
feelings, which were not of the most comfortable
description.</p>

<p>‘Old Truck the smuggling captain,’ continued
the little man, ‘used that cave pretty freely.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>{155}</span>
That was before the geologists had appropriated
it, and the barrier was put up. I should not
wonder if he sometimes wrote hints to his friends
on the walls.’</p>

<p>‘But I should not imagine that your father
knew any one who lived in 1571,’ said Mr Grope.</p>

<p>‘Ah! but is the 1571 a date at all? That’s the
question,’ said the Fellow. ‘My father took an
interest in that old sinner, and saw something
of Truck in his last days in the cottage. The
sea has encroached now and washed most of it
away. And Truck left him his curiosities—stuffed
birds and china, and his old order-books and log-books.
I’ll look them out. I would lay a wager
that he wrote that inscription.’</p>

<p>‘It will take very strong evidence to make that
believed,’ said Mr Grope. Nevertheless he felt
uneasy, and heartily wished that the Fellow had
not happened to take the matter up. Meanwhile
the Fellow searched for Truck’s relics, which were
now in the possession of his brother; and the
next morning saw him in Mr Grope’s study
together with an antique volume, not bound in
‘brass and wild boar’s hide,’ but in dilapidated
leather, with a musty-fusty odour half a century
old. With a sinking heart, Mr Grope felt, when
first he looked at it, that the historical grandeur
of his inscription was about to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>‘This was Truck’s note-book,’ said the Fellow.
‘Look here, Mr Grope.’ And there, on the first
page, written in a manner which implied that the
paper had been rather greasy from the first, were
the words ‘Capt Truck.’</p>

<p>‘And the cave at Q—— is mentioned pretty
often among his hieroglyphics,’ said the ruthless
Fellow, turning over the dirty pages. ‘“Directions
to be left in the Q—— cave.” I expect there are
others there besides the inscription you found.
Look here; don’t you think this must be the
identical one?’ And he pointed to some lines
which ran obliquely across a page: ‘Directions
left for Scroggs. Follow to Normandy. Rum 20,
brandy 15, 71 kegs to return.’</p>

<p>Mr Grope stood stricken to the soul, but not a
muscle of his face moved. He silently compared
this newest discovery with the copy he had made
in his note-book, in the first flush of his hopes.</p>

<p>There was no denying that this was the true
solution of the mystery, and that the Ridolfi Plot
was nowhere. It was singular that neither he
himself, nor Sir H—— T——, nor the other
gentlemen who had written on the subject, had
thought of the possibility of the man in the cave
using straightforward English. At least Mr Grope
erred in good company; but still he felt that he
should have to bear most of the ridicule, as the
originator of the historical theory, and the investigator
who had attacked the smuggler’s prosaic
inscription with five ciphers used by queens and
princes in the sixteenth century. However, he
was determined not to shew his chagrin, and even
asked the Fellow to dine with him that evening.</p>

<p>Mr Grope wrote honourably to the <i>Minerva</i> to
explain the true state of the case. He acknowledged
that further research proved both himself and his
friend Sir H—— T—— to be mistaken on the
subject of the writing in the cave at Q——. Then
he mentioned Truck and the smugglers, and gave
the new interpretation, not without a groan as he
wrote ‘rum’ where formerly he had written ‘<i>rosarum
mensis</i>.’ He also communicated with Sir H——
on the subject, and Sir H—— dryly replied that
he wondered the writing should look as if it were
three hundred years old, when it was really only
sixty or seventy. No more was said about it in
the <i>Minerva</i>. And as to the Q—— people, of
course they politely refrained from letting Mr
Grope see that they laughed at him, all except a
bluff old personage who exclaimed: ‘So your conspirator
against Queen Elizabeth turned out to be
an old smuggler after all!’</p>

<p>The wounds of Mr Grope’s vanity began to
heal in time. They smarted somewhat when
the course of winter lectures at the Q—— Athenæum
was opened, for he had intended to hold
forth triumphantly on the bone-cave and the historical
inscription. And they bled afresh in the
following spring when the annual fashionable pilgrimage
to the cave took place. Still the high-priest
has not deserted the temple, for Mr Grope
is not easily put down; and he often repairs to
his old subterranean haunts and picks up bones
and flint implements. But the entrance to the
new cavern containing the inscription has been
mysteriously filled up again; and the gnome who
is the nominal custodian of the cave whispers to
a subordinate official of the Q—— Athenæum:
‘’Twas Mr Grope, he closed it ’imself, I’ll warrant.
You see, he couldn’t abide it, after that there
mistake of ’is that they laughed at so. Smugglers
’iding there; and Mr Grope, he takes the writin’
for summut to do with grand folks that lived three
’undred year ago!’</p>

<p>Poor Mr Grope! That was all that came of the
inscription in the Q—— bone-cave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HEARTS_OF_OAK_SOCIETY">THE ‘HEARTS OF OAK’ SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the oldest and perhaps the largest of the
Friendly Societies for the benefit of the operative
classes, is the ‘Hearts of Oak,’ which at the present
time numbers over eighty thousand members, and
has a reserve fund of nearly a quarter of a million.
Such extraordinarily large proportions has this
society of late years assumed, and so widespread is
its influence and usefulness, that we feel sure a
short account of its origin and working system
will not be without interest, and maybe profit to
the reader.</p>

<p>Thirty-five years ago—in 1842—the ‘Hearts of
Oak Benefit Society’ was started at the <i>Bird-in-Hand</i>
Tavern, Long Acre, London. Of its history
for the next twenty years little can be said, save
that, although its progress was not anything
remarkable, it worked steadily and honestly at the
object it had in view, and thus firmly established
itself, if it did not produce any extraordinary
success. In 1863 the number of members had
reached eight thousand, a circumstance which
rendered a removal to more commodious premises
necessary; and these were purchased freehold in
Greek Street, Soho. Notwithstanding, however,
this increase of business the amount transacted was
not considered by the promoters of the society in
satisfactory proportion to the justifiable expectations
of such an undertaking, the total number
of members having in 1865 only reached ten
thousand, and this was attributed to the result of
bad administration on the part of the existing
management. A change was made in consequence;
when the present form of government was inaugurated,
which had at once the beneficial effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>{156}</span>
materially increasing the society’s business. So
perceptible and rapid indeed was the progress of
the ‘Hearts of Oak’ after this event, that in the
year 1874 another removal had to be undertaken;
and for this purpose, noble premises in Charlotte
Street, Fitzroy Square, W., were bought and
adapted at a cost of twenty thousand pounds, and
have since served for all the business requirements
of the society.</p>

<p>Having said so much for the history of the
‘Hearts of Oak,’ let us now briefly turn to the
main features and working of the system pursued
by this huge benefit society.</p>

<p>The predominating principle upon which the
system acts seems to be a complete reliance upon
actual merits and on them alone. As a consequence,
a total absence of all external show and
attraction will be found in the administration of
the society. It clings to the term ‘society’ in
opposition to ‘club’ with a most jealous tenacity,
although we confess to seeing very little difference
between the strictly lexical significance of the two
words. Mr Marshall, the able secretary to the
society, is of a different opinion, however, and
holds that the associations which are respectively
bound up with each term differ considerably; a
club being generally looked upon as a meeting for
social purposes, held as a rule at a public-house.
‘It involves,’ he goes on to say, ‘the glass, the
pipe, the song, and other incidents of what is
called good-fellowship; and also in many cases
regalia, processions, dinners, suppers, and other
devices for wasting money and weaning men from
their homes and their families.’ Whether such
‘incidents’ are the associations attached alone to a
club or not, it is not necessary here to determine, it
being sufficient to know that at all events the
‘Hearts of Oak’ does not rely upon any of these
things—although it is common to think that only
by such inducements and attractions can the
working classes be brought into habits and ways
of thrift and saving—and in so doing, the society is
a standing contradiction to all such opinions. It
has never had to resort to any such extraneous aid.
It does not make use of either public-houses or
lodges; it indulges in no dinners or suppers, no
regalia or processions, no pipe, glass, or song; it
employs no agents, canvassers, or collectors; and
it spends no money in commission nor yet in
advertisements, generally so indispensable an aid
to institutions of all kinds. Notwithstanding all
this, the ‘Hearts of Oak’ has of late years admitted
more new members than the increase shewn by
the Odd-fellows, who possess lodges and branches
in every part of the civilised world.</p>

<p>As already stated, the society now numbers more
than eighty thousand members, and these are
formed into divisions of one thousand each; and
each of these divisions holds a meeting at the
society’s house once every month for the transaction
of business, &amp;c. Every candidate for membership
must earn not less than twenty-two shillings
per week, and his age must not be more than
thirty-six; while before election he has of course
to satisfy the committee upon certain points relating
to himself and (if married) his wife, and has
finally to be generally approved of by them.
There are certain trades and occupations which are
considered dangerous and injurious by the society,
and persons belonging thereto are therefore held
ineligible for membership. Each member has to
pay on entrance a fee of two shillings and sixpence
if under thirty-two years of age; and three shillings
and sixpence if over that age and under thirty-six,
the highest limit for admittance. The periodical
contributions amount to about nine shillings
and sixpence each member per quarter; this
sum having been found, however, rather more
than the total average payment for the last six
years. The separate items consist of two and
twopence a month to the society’s stock; and at
each quarterly meeting an equal proportion of the
claims met by the society during the preceding
quarter on account of the various benefits (not
including sickness) it has during that period conferred.
In fact, each quarter every member is
required to clear the books of all demands. After
having belonged to the society for twelve calendar
months, a member who up to that time has paid
all his contributions, can by the payment of an
additional fee of two shillings and sixpence, become
what is termed a <i>free member</i>, such members
having the right to participate in all the benefits
which the society affords.</p>

<p>The benefits offered by the ‘Hearts of Oak’ are:
(1) Sick-pay at the rate of eighteen shillings a
week to <i>free members</i> for twenty-six weeks; and
should the illness continue beyond that period,
half that amount for a further twenty-six weeks;
after which the sick member becomes entitled to
relief from further contributions, and to a pension
payable at a rate in accordance with the length of
his membership. <i>Non-free</i> members participate in
this benefit, but of course on a smaller scale, which,
however, is very liberal. (2) Funeral benefits; being
the allowance of a sum of ten pounds on the death
of a <i>free member’s</i> wife, and double that amount
to the survivors of a free member upon his death.
Certain proportionate rates are granted on the
death of a <i>non-free</i> member, half such rates being
allowed in the event of such a member’s wife
dying. (3) Lying-in benefit; which is the grant
of a sum of thirty shillings on the confinement
of a <i>free member’s</i> wife; the marriage and
birth certificates, duly signed, requiring of course
to be produced on such occasions. And (4) Loss
by fire; being a compensation allowance of not
more than fifteen pounds in the case of any <i>free
member’s</i> tools or implements of trade getting
destroyed or damaged by fire. There are besides
these some miscellaneous benefits to which <i>free
members</i> are entitled, such as allowances for imprisonment
for debt contracted under circumstances
that are in a sense justifiable, or allowances to help
towards defraying the cost of a substitute to <i>free
members</i> who are drawn and liable to serve in the
militia.</p>

<p>These benefits seem to anticipate the chief
emergencies that may happen in the course of
one’s life, as well as providing for the expenses
always attendant upon death; and the allowances
made in respect of them are, it must be admitted,
very liberal, and are doubtless the means of causing
so many poor persons to save in this simple
manner against the occurrence of such untoward
incidents.</p>

<p>The success of the ‘Hearts of Oak’ is largely
due, however, to other causes. Principally, we
think, it may be attributed to the great economy
in its management; as, for instance, it saves a
large sum by the fact of its not being what is
commonly known as a ‘collecting society.’ On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>{157}</span>
the contrary, the members bring or send their
money quite of their own accord; the consequence
being that, while the managerial expenses of some
collecting societies vary from 25 to 70 per cent. on
the annual income, the expenses of the ‘Hearts of
Oak’ amount only to 3¾ or 4 per cent.</p>

<p>Another favourable point in the system pursued
by this society is, that all members pay alike.
Technically of course this must be considered
unscientific, but in the aggregate the system is
found to pay; just as the same charge for a telegram
whether it be to Aberdeen or to the next
street is also unscientific, but practically answers
well. The great argument in favour of the system
seems to be the fact that it promotes business—and
what more is wanted? Our large insurance
companies report about one thousand policies as
good work for one year; whereas the ‘Hearts of
Oak’ on its system reports over sixteen thousand
new members during the same period. On some
such system as this it were not impossible, we think,
for the whole life-insurance business of the city of
London to be done by one well-conducted office; in
which case the insured would certainly derive one
great benefit—namely, that of having to pay very
much less, perhaps only one-half of the usual
premium.</p>

<p>Another counterpoise to the disadvantage of
charging all members alike is, that a lying-in
benefit of thirty shillings—as already shewn—is
allowed. To young men this has a great attraction;
and the result is that the average age of
joining the society is only twenty-seven. So rapid
indeed has been the growth of the ‘Hearts of
Oak,’ that an average age of the whole society,
which ten years ago was nearly thirty-four years,
is now only about thirty-three years.</p>

<p>One other circumstance which we fancy may
have something to do with the success of the
society is worth mentioning—it is the business-like
manner in which the system adopted is carried
out. Perfect discipline among the members is maintained,
and a strict adherence to the rules that have
been made enforced. Every infraction of a rule is
promptly visited by the imposition of a fine on the
offending member; and so stringent is the society
in this respect, that the amount which annually
accrues under this head is very large. In the
accounts of the ‘Hearts of Oak’ for 1876 we notice
that this item reaches the large sum of L.6949, 13s.
6d.; which not only served to defray the year’s expenses
of the society (namely, L.5819, 9s. 7d.), but
left a balance of L.1130, 3s. 11d. It can hardly be
considered as exactly any merit of the society that
it is thus able to pay its expenses; yet there stands
the fact, whatever we may think of it. It is only
fair, however, to state that the greater part of this
large amount arises from a fine of ninepence imposed
upon members who fail to clear the books
by their quarterly night. This is levied more as a
sort of interest for a month’s longer use of the
money; and it is a striking instance of innate
want of thrift on the part of the working classes,
that so many are willing to pay ninepence for the
use of ten shillings for the month, rather than
arrange to be prompt in their payments. The
revenue derived from this fine alone is about four
thousand pounds a year. It is a curious fact too,
that of the total number of members on the books
at any one time, it is always found that just one-third
will not pay at the quarter, and have therefore
to be fined. In thus deferring their payments,
these members are the means of allowing both the
monthly and quarterly payments being reserved
entirely for the purposes of the benefits already
enumerated, and for profit; under which head the
surplus now amounts to forty thousand pounds per
annum; in point of fact, the cost of management
has always been paid for by these miscellaneous
receipts. This substantial advantage is probably
caused unwittingly on the members’ part, but it is
not the less felt or beneficial for all that.</p>

<p>Having briefly pointed out the main features
and benefits of the ‘Hearts of Oak,’ it only remains
for us to add one word as to the great usefulness
of such societies. Notwithstanding the great success
of the Post-office savings-banks and such
other banks as are intended for the deposit of small
sums, it is our belief that they are not so conducive
to permanent saving and thrift among the poorer
classes as may be supposed. The number of
deposits in the postal banks in any one year is
no doubt very great; but on the other hand, the
number of withdrawals is also great; and from
this fact we infer that the larger part of the sums
placed there is more for the sake of temporary
safety than with any view of permanent saving.
Hence then the great usefulness of societies which
yield ultimate benefits for present contributions. As
already pointed out, the difficulty of persuading
the poorer classes to save in this manner is by no
means great; and once, therefore, a working man
has become a member of such a society, he knows
he must pay regularly; which when he becomes
accustomed to it, he only feels as a natural duty,
like the house-rent he has to pay, or any other such
tax. A further advantage of societies too is, that
his contributions cannot be regained, except indeed
at a considerable loss; but in the savings-banks
it is always at his own discretion to draw out his
deposits; a discretion often not very wisely used.
In this comparison, however, it is by no means
our wish to suggest the slightest disparagement of
savings-banks, which in their way are most useful
to all who are really anxious to lay by. We have
only desired to shew more forcibly the benefits of
societies like the ‘Hearts of Oak,’ that thereby those
whom it may concern may be induced—if they have
not already done so—to become members.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DALESFOLK">THE DALESFOLK.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the spinning-jenny and the steam-engine
revolutionised our manner of living, there existed
among the hills and dales of the Lake countries
a little community which had its own peculiar
manners, laws, and customs, and which was something
unique in its way, for it seemed to be a
kind of republic existing in the midst of a great
empire. The people were what are now called
peasant proprietors, but in Cumberland and Westmoreland
they have always been named ‘statesmen.’
A few of these ancient land-owners still
exist, and their tenure of the land which they possess
is not feudal but allodial, in so far as that they
acquired their estates at a very remote period, either
by establishing themselves on unoccupied lands
like the ‘settlers’ in Australia or America, or by
conquering previous possessors. Several of these
statesmen possess estates which have descended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>{158}</span>
uninterruptedly in their families since the time of
Richard II., and always as ‘customary freeholds;’
while one family, the Holmes of Mardale, have
inherited their land in unbroken succession since
the year 1060, when a certain John Holme came
from Norway and settled in the district.</p>

<p>When James II. came to the throne he set up a
claim to all those small estates, on the plea that
the statesmen were merely tenants of the crown.
But his claim was met by the sturdy Dalesfolk in
a manner which he little expected. They met to
the number of two thousand, at a place called
Ratten Heath, and publicly declared that ‘they
had won their lands by the sword, and by the
sword they would keep them.’</p>

<p>Owing to the smallness of the estates, there was
not sufficient employment in farm-work at all
times for a statesman and his family, and carding,
spinning, and weaving formed the employment for
the winter months. The men carded, and the
women spun the wool yielded by the previous
clipping. Nearly every household had its weaving-shop,
where one or two looms were kept, and
many of the men were able to weave the cloth
which served for their own wear and that of their
families. The linsey-woolsey dresses worn by the
women were homespun, and they also manufactured
linen for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>The process of preparing the cloth was a curious
one, and deserves mention. After a web of woollen
cloth was turned out of the loom, it was taken to
the ‘beck’ or stream and soaked in the water; then
it was placed on a flat stone called the ‘battling-stone’
and well pounded with a wooden mallet.
This primitive operation served instead of the
elaborate processes through which woollen cloth
now passes at the fuller’s mill.</p>

<p>The costume of the Dalesmen was rather picturesque,
being composed of homespun fleeces of
white or black, with occasionally a mixture of the
two colours to save the expense of dyeing. This
homely material, which is still made in some parts
of Scotland and Ireland, has lately become fashionable,
and is pronounced to be superior for country
wear to the most finished products of our steam-looms.
The coats were ornamented with brass
buttons, as were also the waistcoats, which were
made open in front to shew a frilled shirt-breast.
Knee-breeches were the fashion for centuries,
and these were worn without braces, which are
quite a modern invention. Those used on Sundays
or holidays had a knot of ribbon and four or five
bright buttons at the knee, and those who could
afford it had them made of buckskin. Their
stockings, which were of course a conspicuous
part of their dress, were also made from their own
wool, the colour being either blue or gray. Clogs
were their ordinary ‘shoon,’ but when dressed in
holiday costume they had low shoes fastened with
buckles, which were often of silver.</p>

<p>At the present day this picturesque costume is
nearly obsolete, but some of the old Dalesmen still
adhere to the fashion of their youth. About five
or six years ago a few of them happened to meet
at Grasmere Fair and stood chatting together for
some time without noticing what many other
persons were remarking, namely, that all of them
were dressed in the old costume. When they did
notice it they all agreed that it was a somewhat
singular coincidence, and a proper occasion for a
friendly glass in honour of ‘auld lang syne.’
They were the connecting link between the old
times and the new, and would probably be the
last of the Dalesfolk to wear the costume of the
bygone age.</p>

<p>The dress of the Daleswomen was not less
primitive than that of the men. They wore
homespun linsey-woolsey petticoats and gowns,
a blue linen apron completing their attire. The
statesman’s daughter who first communicated to
her native place a knowledge of the glories of
printed calico is said to have created a great sensation,
and was more than a nine days’ wonder. The
clogs worn by the women were pointed at the toes
and were clasped with brass instead of iron. Their
bonnets were made of pasteboard covered with
black silk, and in shape resembled a coal-scuttle,
with the front projecting about a foot beyond the
face of the wearer.</p>

<p>The houses of the Dalesfolk were not of the
most comfortable kind, and were similar to those
which exist at the present day in many of the
southern counties of England. Badly constructed
with rough-hewn stones, and joined with clay
instead of mortar, they did not always shelter the
inmates from the ‘cauld blast;’ while it was no
uncommon thing for the roofs to be in such a state
that when a snow-storm took place in the night,
people in bed would often find several inches of
snow on their bed-clothes the next morning. The
wood used in the construction of the houses was
oak; doors, floors, and window-frames being all of
that sturdy material. The beams were made of
whole trees roughly squared, while the smaller
rafters and joists were split. Most of these old
buildings had a porch before the outer door, the
latter being of massive oak, two planks thick, and
fastened together with wooden pegs (for the carpenters
in those days used very few nails), which
were put in parallel rows about three or four
inches apart and left projecting about three-quarters
of an inch on the outside. About six hundred
of these pegs were used in its construction, and
the making of them occupied as much time as it
would take to make a dozen doors in our busier
times. A degree of sanctity was, however,
attached to a door by these simple folk, and certain
charms to be used only at the threshold
are remembered even now in the Dales.</p>

<p>In dwellings of the usual size there were not
more than three rooms on the ground floor, namely
the living-apartment, the dairy, and the parlour,
the last being generally used as the bedroom of
the master and mistress. In some cases there was
an out-kitchen, but not in all.</p>

<p>Long after the use of coal and fire-grates became
general throughout England these people still continued
to burn peat and wood upon the open
hearth, and it was not until half the present
century had elapsed that, railway communication
making coal cheaper, and the increased value of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>{159}</span>
labour making peat dearer, coal finally triumphed
and open fire-places gave place to grates. The old
chimneys had no flues, and were very wide at the
bottom, gradually contracting towards the top, and
in these chimneys hams, legs of beef, flitches of
bacon, and whole carcases of mutton were hung up
to dry for winter consumption.</p>

<p>The food of the Dalesmen was confined almost
wholly to the simple products of their own farms.
They consumed a large portion of animal food, and
as sheep and cattle were in the best condition for
slaughtering in autumn, it was then that the Dalesfolk
stocked their wide chimneys with a supply
of meat for the winter and spring. Tea, coffee,
and wheaten bread were very little known in the
Dales; oatcake (Anglicè), or ‘haver-bread’ as it
was termed, being used. The people brewed their
own beer and drank it at nearly every meal. Such,
with milk, butter, and cheese, was the food of these
honest folk, and they seemed to have thriven
well on it. When tea, coffee, and sugar came into
general use, an old Dalesman remarked that he
wondered ‘what t’ warl’ wod cum tew after a bit
when fowk nooadays couldn’t git their breakfast
without hevvin stuff fra baith East and West
Indies.’</p>

<p>Until the middle of last century the roads of
the two counties were in a wretched state; and
instead of wheeled carriages, pack-horses and in
some cases sledges were used for conveying things
from one place to another. There is an old
man now living in Grasmere whose grandmother
could remember the present church bells being
brought thither by sledges along the old road over
the top of White Moss, then the main road
between Ambleside and Grasmere. A man and
his wife often rode to market together on the
same horse, the woman sitting behind on what
was called a pillion. But the Dalesfolk were not
very particular as to their turn-out, for a piece
of turf dried and cut into the proper shape often
served them as a saddle. Other saddles were pads
of straw; and on market-days, after business was
over, such of the farmers as were convivially
disposed stayed on at the public-house or inn,
holding a ‘crack’ and drinking till a late hour;
and while a spree of this kind was going on, it
often happened that the poor hungry horses would
break loose and eat up all the straw pads, thus
leaving their owners to ride home bareback!</p>

<p>The Dalesfolk were rather superstitious; and
there is an old story in the local records about the
way in which the first lime was introduced to the
district. It was carried on the back of a horse,
and as they neared Borrowdale a thunder-storm
came on, and the lime in the sack began to smoke.
Thinking the sack was on fire, the man in charge
went and filled his hat with water from a ditch,
and threw it into the sack. As this made things
worse, he grew terribly alarmed, and thinking the
Evil One had something to do with it, he pitched
the lime into the ditch, and leaping on to the horse,
galloped home as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Ploughing was attended with hard labour to
those employed, and it required at least three men
and three horses to work one plough. The horses
were yoked one before another, and it was as
much as one man could do to drive them. A
second man held the plough-beam down, to prevent
the plough from slipping out of the earth;
while it was the work of a third to guide the
whole concern, this part of the business requiring
the most skill. Sometimes a fourth man was
employed with pick and spade to turn up the
places missed by the plough. Very little skill
or labour was expended in the making of the
implement, and it was nothing unusual for a tree
growing in the morning to be cut down during
the day, and made into a plough, with which a
good stroke of work was done before night.</p>

<p>These good people worked much harder than
their descendants of the present day. Their hours
of labour were much longer, and much of what
they did by hand is now done by machinery.
Though ignorant and unrefined, they were honest
and hospitable, and possessed a great deal of
sound shrewd common-sense. In those days many
of them followed several handicrafts, for the
division of labour was not such as it is now;
and a remarkable instance of this diversified
ability is to be found in the life of the man who
was the parish priest of Wordsworth’s poem, <i>The
Excursion</i>. This worthy man—whose history we
have slightly alluded to in an article in this
<i>Journal</i> on the Lake Country—was the son of a
poor statesman, and was the youngest of twelve.
At the age of seventeen he became a village
schoolmaster, and a little later both minister and
schoolmaster. Before and after school-hours he
laboured at manual occupation, rising between
three and four in the summer, and working in
the fields with the scythe or sickle. He ploughed,
he planted, tended sheep, or clipped and salved,
all for hire; wrote his own sermons, and did
his duty at chapel twice on Sundays. In all
these labours he excelled. In winter-time he
occupied himself in reading, writing his own
sermons, spinning, and making his own clothes
and those of his family, knitting and mending
his own stockings, and making his own shoes, the
leather of which was of his own tanning. In his
walks he never neglected to gather and bring
home the wool from the hedges. He was also
the physician and lawyer of his parishioners; drew
up their wills, conveyances, bonds, &amp;c., wrote all
their letters, and settled their accounts, and often
went to market with sheep or wool for the
farmers.</p>

<p>He married a respectable maid-servant, who
brought him forty pounds; and shortly afterwards
he became curate of Seathwaite, where he lived and
officiated for sixty-seven years. We are told that
when his family wanted cloth, he often took the
spinning-wheel into the school-room, where he
also kept a cradle—of course of his own making.
Not unfrequently the wheel, the cradle, and the
scholars all claiming his attention at the same
moment, taxed the ingenuity of this wonderful
man to keep them all going. To all these attainments
Mr Walker—or ‘Wonderful Walker,’ as he
was called—also added a knowledge of fossils and
plants, and a ‘habit’ of observing the stars and
winds. In summer he also collected various
insects, and by his entertaining descriptions of
them amused and instructed his children. After
a long and extremely useful, nay we might say
heroic life, which extended over nearly the whole
of the last century (he having been born in 1709),
this remarkable Dalesman died on the 25th of
June 1802, in the ninety-third year of his age.
In the course of his life he had, besides bringing
up and settling in life a family of twelve children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>{160}</span>
amassed the sum of two thousand pounds, the
result of marvellous industry and self-denial.</p>

<p>The chapel where this celebrated man entered
upon his sacred duties was the smallest in the Dales,
the poet Wordsworth, Mr Walker’s biographer,
describing it as scarcely larger than many of the
fragments of rock lying near it. Most of these
small chapelries were presided over by ‘readers,’
men who generally exercised the trades of clogger,
tailor, and butter-print maker, in order to eke out
their small stipend. The livings were not worth
more than two or three pounds a year, and the
ministers were dependent upon the voluntary contributions
of their parishioners. Their stipends,
beside the small money-payment mentioned above,
comprised ‘clothes yearly and whittlegate.’ The
former meant one suit of clothes, two pairs of
shoes, and one pair of clogs; and the latter, two or
three weeks’ victuals at each house according to the
ability of the inhabitants, which was settled among
themselves; so that the minister could ‘go his
course’ as regularly as the sun, and complete it
annually. Few houses having more than one or
two knives, he was obliged to carry his own knife
or ‘whittle.’ He marched from house to house,
and as master of the flock, had the elbow-chair at
the table-head. Some remarkable scenes were often
the result of this droll arrangement, and many
good stories are current with reference to it. A
story is told in Whythburn of a minister who had
but two sermons, which he preached in turn.
The walls of the chapel were at that time unplastered,
and the sermons were usually placed in a
hole in the wall behind the pulpit. On Sunday,
before the service began, some wag pushed the
sermons so far into the hole that they could not be
got out with the hand. When the time for the
sermon had arrived, the minister tried in vain to
get them out. He then turned to the congregation
and said that he could touch them with his forefinger,
but couldn’t get his thumb in to grasp them.
‘But however,’ said he, ‘I will read you a chapter
of Job instead, and that’s worth both of them put
together!’</p>

<p>There was a curious custom at one time in the
Dales of holding market at the church. Meat
and all kinds of things were displayed at the
church doors, and it often happened that people
would make their bargains first and hang their
goods over the backs of their seats. Though such
practices have long been discontinued, there are
still people living who have heard the clerk give
out in the churchyard the advertisements of the
several sales which were to be held in the neighbourhood.
One good custom there was, however,
which might be often practised now with advantage
in small towns and villages, namely, that of
the churchwardens going round the village during
divine service and driving all the loungers into
church.</p>

<p>The Dalesfolk had their sports too, the chief of
which was the one for which Cumberland and
Westmoreland have ever been famous, namely
wrestling. They were also keen hunters; and
until quite a recent period a few couples of hounds
were kept in every dale, and when the presence of
a fox was betrayed by a missing lamb or a
decimated hen-roost, all the dogs and nearly all
the men in the parish entered in pursuit of the
depredator, and were seldom balked by their
victim.</p>

<p>Some songs that were in vogue in the Dales a
hundred years ago are still sung, chiefly at fairs
by itinerant ballad-mongers. Some of the tunes
are very antique, as for instance, <i>St Dunstan’s
Hunt’s Up</i>, mentioned by Sir Walter Scott as lost
and forgotten, but which is still played on the
fiddle every Christmas-eve. The festivals held
from time to time in the Dales were such as were
very common in all parts of ‘Merrie England’
when our forefathers worked hard, and money
was much scarcer than it is now. That they
worked harder on the whole is a thing which
admits of two opinions; but one thing is certain,
namely, that their work was of a steady, careful,
easy-going kind, whilst now it is all bustle and
drive, in the endeavour to cram into a few fleeting
hours as much as they could do in a whole week.
Such as we find the world, however, we must put
up with it, content, like them, to keep pegging
away, and meeting the storms and buffetings of
life with the same courageous spirit which enabled
them to add their mite towards the honour, glory,
and welfare of our common country.</p>
